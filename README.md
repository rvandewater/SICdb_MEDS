The SICdb dataset offers insights into over 27 thousand intensive care admissions, including therapies and data on
preceding surgeries. Data were collected between 2013 and 2021 from four different intensive care units at the
University Hospital Salzburg, having more than 3 thousand intensive care admissions per year on 41 beds. The dataset is
deidentified and contains, amongst others, case information, vital signs, laboratory results and medication data. SICdb
provides both aggregated once-per-hour and highly granular once-per-minute data, making it suitable for computational
and machine learning-based research. (source: https://www.sicdb.com/Documentation/Main_Page)
